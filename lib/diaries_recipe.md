# 1
First of all, I need a diary to add the diary entries:
bootcamp_diary = Diary.new ()

# 2
Then I will test the behaviour when empty
bootcamp_diary.all = []

# 3
Create a first entry to the diary
entry_01 = {title}, {contents...}

# 4
Create a second entry
entry_02 = {title2}, {contents2...}

# 5
Add the entries to the diary

# 6
Call method all and see how the diary is
